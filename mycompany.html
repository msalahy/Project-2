      <h3>Who We Are? </h3>
      <aside><img src="pictures/herayheadshot-2.jpg" alt="Mohammad Picture"></aside>
      <p>We are a group of family farmers, from Herat Afghanistan, who have been cultivating saffron “Queen of Spices” in the past seven years. We import our family’s and other family farmers' saffron to United States.Heray Spice Team is a group of two US Army linguists, who served the Army in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>In 2001, when the United Nations and the USA launched the Operation Enduring Freedom Mission in Afghanistan, we (The Heray Spice Team) stepped up to support the U.S. Army as local military linguists. On September 2014 we immigrated to Chicago; after three years of being in US we established Heray Spice for an opportunity to “replace weapons with pens” </p>

      <h3>What Saffron</h3>
      <aside><img src="pictures/pic4.JPG" alt="Mohammad Picture"><img src="pictures/pic5.JPG" alt="Mohammad Picture"></aside>
      <p> Saffron threads are the stigmas of the Crocus Sativus Linnaeus. Because of saffron health benefits, its price, and aromatic qualities, it is called “Queen of Spices,” and in Afghanistan, it is called, “Red Gold.” Its ethereal flavor makes a perfect enrichment for savory and sweetened plates.</p>
      <p>It takes 225,000 stigmas (or 75,000 blossoms) to make a pound of saffron. It comes from the internal of the amethyst-colored saffron crocus and must be hand-harvested due to its delicateness. </p>
      <h3> Our Social Cause</h3>
      <aside><img src="pictures/pic8.jpg" alt="Mohammad Picture"></aside>
      <p><b>For Afghan Children</b></p><p>Our company pays 10% of its income to build and supply schools for Afghan Children. These are the three schools that we are currently covering: Pashtoon Zarghoon Elementary School, Chongar Elementary School, and Imam Shishnoor High School. </p>
      <p>So far we sent 12 students back to school. On average in a year, it costs $90 to send a child to school; however, due to economic hardship many children drop elementary school in those early crucial year.</p>
